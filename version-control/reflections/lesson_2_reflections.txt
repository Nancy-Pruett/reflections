What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  You need to make the folder trackable on git

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is in an initialized directory and contains the files to be committed.  It allows you to make a commit while stile having changes saved in your working directory that aren't ready to be committed yet.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  check the staging area vs the working directory ( git diff )

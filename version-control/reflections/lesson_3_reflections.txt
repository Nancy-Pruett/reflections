When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If you have multiple computers or people, or if you're afraid of losing data on one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are only on GitHub.  clones are exact copies - use them when you want a copy somewhere else or before editing a copy if you don't want to change the initial.  Branches exist within a single repository but are different version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  If you go offline, you have access to the remote.  also you can check diff with the remote
